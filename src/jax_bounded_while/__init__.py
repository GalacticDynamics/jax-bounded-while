def bounded_while_loop(

    *,
    max_steps: int,
) -> T:
    r"""Reverse-mode-friendly, bounded `while_loop` implemented via `lax.scan`.

    This function emulates:

    ```python
    val = init_val
    i = 0
    while cond_fn(val) and i < max_steps:
        val = body_fn(val)
        i += 1
    return val
    ```

    but with two crucial differences:

    1. **A hard iteration bound**: the loop is unrolled as a fixed-length `scan`
       of length `max_steps`. This is often much friendlier to reverse-mode AD
       than an unbounded `lax.while_loop`.
    2. **Early stop without wasted work**: once the user condition fails
       (i.e. `cond_fn(val)` becomes `False`), we stop applying `body_fn` and
       run only a no-op for the remaining scan steps. This preserves the fixed
       length required by `scan` *without* performing unnecessary computation.

    If the user condition is still `True` after `max_steps` iterations (i.e. the
    loop would continue), an error is raised using `equinox.error_if`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cond_fn
        Predicate of the loop, in the same sense as `jax.lax.while_loop`:
        it should return a boolean scalar indicating whether to **continue**
        iterating. The loop halts when this becomes `False`.
    body_fn
        Loop body, mapping the loop carry to a new carry.
    init_val
        Initial loop carry (any PyTree of JAX arrays / scalars / nested containers).
    max_steps
        Maximum number of iterations to attempt. Must be a non-negative Python int.

    Returns
    -------
    T
        Final carry value, either when `cond_fn` first returns `False`, or (if
        that never happens) after `max_steps` iterations (but in that case an
        error is raised).

    Examples
    --------
    Simple loop over a scalar value:

    >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
    >>> from jax_bounded_while import bounded_while_loop
    >>> def cond_fn(x):
    ...     return x < 5
    >>> def body_fn(x):
    ...     return x + 1
    >>> bounded_while_loop(cond_fn, body_fn, jnp.asarray(0), max_steps=10)
    Array(5, dtype=int32, ...)

    Same loop but with a PyTree carry (tuple):

    >>> def cond_fn(state):
    ...     x, _ = state
    ...     return x < 3
    >>> def body_fn(state):
    ...     x, y = state
    ...     return x + 1, y * 2
    >>> bounded_while_loop(cond_fn, body_fn, (jnp.asarray(0), jnp.asarray(1)),
    ...                    max_steps=5)
    (Array(3, dtype=int32, ...), Array(8, dtype=int32, ...))

    Notes
    -----
    Semantics and implementation details:

    We convert the unbounded while loop into a bounded scan by augmenting the
    carry with a boolean flag `done`:

    - `done == False` means we are still logically inside the while loop.
    - `done == True` means the loop has logically terminated; remaining scan
      steps must be no-ops.

    At each scan step we do:

    - If `done` is already `True`: do nothing (no-op).
    - Else (not done):
        - Evaluate `continue_ = cond_fn(val)`.
        - If `continue_` is `True`: apply `body_fn`.
        - If `continue_` is `False`: mark `done = True` and do *not* apply
          `body_fn`.

    After the scan finishes, if `done` is still `False`, then `cond_fn` never
    became false within the allowed steps, meaning the bounded loop
    "overflowed".

    Notes on efficiency:

    - The remaining post-termination scan iterations are routed through a branch
      that returns the carry unchanged. At runtime this avoids executing
      `body_fn` after termination.
    - `body_fn` and `cond_fn` are still traced/compiled as part of the JAX
      program (that is unavoidable), but they are not *executed* once
      `done=True`.
